# Kotlin Playground

During my last experience in a type-script, react web-application which most of its logic was front-end (start-up environment),
I have missed the back side.

Following the shutdown of the business, I'm going to use this project to go back to the JVM and especially play with Kotlin.
I have always been attracted to it because of its expressiveness, readability and want to compare it to Java and JS/TS.

So this project is my playground to discover some of its benefits and limits

## Goals

* Set up a server
* Use external APIs
* Implement a DSL
* Provide APIs 
* Integrate with an external Authentication and Authorization service
* Integrate with a DB

Let's play!

## Table of Contents

- [Authentication](#Authentication)
- [Troubleshooting](#Troubleshooting)

## Authentication 

I use a free Auth0 instance for the Identity and Access Management service. It supports JWT standard.

TODO  - Authorization
